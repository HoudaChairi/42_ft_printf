## Ft_printf
The ft_printf project is a common assignment at 42 coding schools, where you are tasked with creating a simplified version of the C standard library function `printf()`. The goal is to improve your programming skills, particularly in areas like string manipulation, argument parsing, and format specifier handling.

## Requirements
The main requirements for the ft_printf project typically include:

1. Implement the following conversion specifiers: `c`, `s`, `p`, `d`, `i`, `u`, `x`, `X`, `%`.
2. Handle flag characters: `-`, `+`, `#`, `0`, and `' '` (space).
3. Handle minimum field width.
4. Handle precision.
5. Handle the `%` conversion specifier.
6. Return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
7. Use a custom buffer management system to improve performance.
8. Implement the project in C, following the guidelines and standards set by the 42 coding school.

## Design Suggestions
When approaching this project, consider the following design suggestions:

1. **Modular Structure**: Break down the project into smaller, reusable functions that handle specific tasks, such as parsing format specifiers, converting data types, and managing the output buffer.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle invalid input or unsupported features.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Focus on efficient buffer management and minimizing unnecessary string operations to improve the overall performance of your ft_printf implementation.
4. **Readability and Maintainability**: Write clean, well-documented code that is easy to understand and modify in the future.
5. **Test Coverage**: Thoroughly test your implementation to ensure it meets all the requirements and handles edge cases correctly.

## Approach the Project Systematically
- Break down the project requirements into smaller, manageable tasks.
- Tackle each requirement one at a time, starting with the most basic functionality.
- Implement and test each component thoroughly before moving on to the next.
